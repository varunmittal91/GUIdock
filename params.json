As a proof of concept, we focus on supporting Cytoscape, a Java-based standalone program with a graphical user interface for the visualization and analyses of gene networks in biology. In addition to Cytoscape, our container includes R, Rserve, Bioconductor packages igraph, networkBMA and a Cytoscape app called CyNetworkBMA. GUIdock contains the entire pipeline and all the tools (including Cytoscape that connects to preloaded RServe, a Bioconductor package called “networkBMA” and all its dependencies) to generate gene regulatory networks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
